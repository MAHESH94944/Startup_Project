## Guide for Frontend Developers

This document provides all necessary information to integrate the frontend with our ecommerce backend API.

### Important Concepts

1.  **Cold Starts**: Our backend is hosted on Render's free tier. The first request after a period of inactivity may take **10-30 seconds** to process as the server "wakes up". Please implement loading indicators in the UI to handle this delay. You can use the `/health` endpoint to "warm up" the server.

2.  **Authentication**: We use a secure, cookie-based authentication system. The JWT token is stored in an `httpOnly` cookie. For your frontend requests to work, you **must** include `credentials: 'include'` in your `fetch` or `axios` configuration.

3.  **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is configured to only allow requests from the following domains:
    - `https://warnershoes.onrender.com` (Main Frontend)
    - `https://warnershoesadmin.onrender.com` (Admin Frontend)
    - `http://localhost:5173` (Local Development)

## API Reference

### Health Check

A simple endpoint to verify that the server is running.

- **GET** `/health`
  - **Success Response (200):** `{"status": "OK", "timestamp": "..."}`

---

### Authentication Endpoints

Endpoints for user registration, login, and session management.

#### 1. Register User

- **POST** `/api/auth/register`
- **Description:** Creates a new user account.
- **Body:** `{ "name": "...", "email": "...", "password": "..." }`
- **Success (201):** `{ "message": "User registered successfully", "user": {...} }`
- **Error (400):** `{ "message": "Email already exists" }` or validation error.

#### 2. Login User

- **POST** `/api/auth/login`
- **Description:** Authenticates a user and sets the session cookie.
- **Body:** `{ "email": "...", "password": "..." }`
- **Success (200):** `{ "message": "Login successful", "user": {...} }`
- **Error (400):** `{ "message": "Invalid credentials" }`

#### 3. Google OAuth Login

- **GET** `/api/auth/google`
- **Description:** Redirects the user to Google's OAuth screen. After successful authentication, the user is **redirected back to your frontend application** (as defined by `FRONTEND_URL` in `.env`). The session cookie is set automatically by the server.
- **Usage:** Your frontend should have a "Login with Google" button that navigates to this URL. Your frontend application should then check the user's authentication status (e.g., by calling `/api/auth/me`) when it loads after the redirect.

#### 4. Get Current Authenticated User

- **GET** `/api/auth/me`
- **Description:** Retrieves the currently logged-in user's basic info. Ideal for checking authentication status on app load.
- **Auth:** Required.
- **Success (200):** `{ "user": {...} }`
- **Error (401):** `{ "message": "Not authorized, no token" }`

#### 5. Logout User

- **POST** `/api/auth/logout`
- **Description:** Clears the session cookie, logging the user out.
- **Auth:** Required.
- **Success (200):** `{ "message": "Logged out successfully" }`

### User Profile Endpoints

#### 1. Get User Profile

- **GET** `/api/user/profile`
- **Description:** Retrieves the full profile of the currently logged-in user.

### Troubleshooting

#### Login Session Not Persisting After Refresh

If you find that users are logged out after refreshing the page, it's almost always a cookie issue.

1.  **Persistent Cookies**: The backend is now configured to set a persistent cookie with a `maxAge` of 7 days for all login methods (local and Google).
2.  **`credentials: 'include'`**: Ensure your frontend `fetch` or `axios` requests **always** include this option. Without it, the browser will not send the cookie back to the server on subsequent requests.
3.  **Browser DevTools**: Use the "Application" tab in your browser's developer tools to inspect the cookie. Check that the `token` cookie exists, and that its `Expires / Max-Age` is set to a future date.
4.  **`sameSite: 'lax'`**: The cookie policy has been updated to `lax` for better compatibility with cross-site redirects from Google.

### Session / Token Behavior

Browsers (Safari, Brave, some Chrome settings) may block cross-site cookies (SameSite=None) by default. To ensure reliability:

1. Backend sets httpOnly cookie (7 days) and also returns `token` in JSON.
2. Frontend SHOULD send `credentials: 'include'` on every request.
3. If cookie is absent after a refresh:
   - Store `token` from login response (localStorage/sessionStorage) and send: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
