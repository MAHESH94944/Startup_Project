## Guide for Frontend Developers

This document provides all necessary information to integrate the frontend with our ecommerce backend API.

### Important Concepts

1.  **Cold Starts**: Our backend is hosted on Render's free tier. The first request after a period of inactivity may take **10-30 seconds** to process as the server "wakes up". Please implement loading indicators in the UI to handle this delay. You can use the `/health` endpoint to "warm up" the server.

2.  **Authentication**: We use a secure, cookie-based authentication system. The JWT token is stored in an `httpOnly` cookie. For your frontend requests to work, you **must** include `credentials: 'include'` in your `fetch` or `axios` configuration.

3.  **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is configured to only allow requests from the domain specified in the `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable. For local development, you may need to add your localhost URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) to the allowed origins in `app.js`.

### Performance & Deployment Notes

- **Slow Initial Deployment**: The deployment process may seem slow the first time after adding new dependencies (like `imagekit` and `multer`). This is because the hosting service (Render) needs to download and install all packages from scratch.
- **Faster Subsequent Deployments**: Future deployments will be much faster as Render caches the installed dependencies (`node_modules`). The slowness is typically a one-time event per dependency change.
- **Code Optimization**: The controllers have been optimized to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability. The core logic remains the same.

### Authentication Endpoints

Endpoints for user registration, login, and session management.

#### 1. Register User

- **POST** `/api/auth/register`
- **Description:** Creates a new user account.
- **Body:** `{ "name": "...", "email": "...", "password": "..." }`
